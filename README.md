# Kerberos RC4/DES Active Directory Security Scanning Tool

**Version**: 6.0  
**Author**: Jan Tiedemann  
**Created**: October 2025  
**Updated**: October 2025

A comprehensive PowerShell script to audit and remediate DES/RC4 kerberos encryption usage in Active Directory forests. This tool helps identify security vulnerabilities related to weak kerberos DES/RC4 encryption settings on AD objects like computer and trusts and provides options to upgrade to stronger AES encryption. It can also scan for GPOs that might already configuring AES related `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` settings.

## Overview

RC4 is a deprecated encryption algorithm that is considered cryptographically weak. This tool uses **modern post-November 2022 Microsoft logic** to accurately analyze your Active Directory environment and identify genuine security risks.

### November 2022 Update Changes

Microsoft's November 2022 Kerberos updates fundamentally changed how encryption fallback works:

- **Trust Objects**: Now **default to AES encryption** when `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` is undefined (secure by default)
- **Computer Objects**: Safely inherit Domain Controller encryption policies when DCs are properly configured
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Only flags objects with actual RC4 fallback risk, not false positives from undefined attributes

#### Official Microsoft Documentation

This tool implements guidance from these authoritative Microsoft sources:

**November 2022 Changes and Modern Kerberos Logic:**
- [What happened to Kerberos Authentication after installing the November 2022/OOB updates?](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/askds/what-happened-to-kerberos-authentication-after-installing-the-november-2022oob-u/3696351)
  - Explains the fundamental changes to RC4 fallback behavior
  - Details when objects actually pose RC4 fallback risk vs. when they're secure
  - Clarifies that RC4 fallback only occurs under specific conditions

**Trust Objects and AES Defaults:**
- [Decrypting the Selection of Supported Kerberos Encryption Types](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/coreinfrastructureandsecurityblog/decrypting-the-selection-of-supported-kerberos-encryption-types/1628797)
  - **Update section states**: "The November 2022 update changed the logic for referral ticket encryption. As a result it is no longer necessary to manually enable AES for trusts."
  - Confirms that trust objects now default to AES encryption when undefined

### What This Tool Identifies

Using modern logic, this tool identifies:
- Computers with explicitly weak encryption settings (RC4-only without AES)
- Trust objects explicitly configured for RC4-only (rare in modern environments)
- Computers at RC4 fallback risk (only when both client AND Domain Controllers lack proper AES configuration)
- Domain Controller encryption configuration status for context-aware analysis

### What This Tool No Longer Flags as Problematic

Based on November 2022 updates:
- ✅ **Trust objects with undefined encryption** (now default to AES)
- ✅ **Computer objects with undefined encryption when DCs have AES** (inherit secure policy)
- ✅ **Legacy "RC4 fallback" warnings for properly configured environments**

### Practical Impact for Your Environment

**If you're running this tool for the first time post-November 2022:**
- **Expect fewer flagged objects** compared to older tools using pre-2022 logic
- **Trust objects may show as secure** even without explicit AES configuration
- **Computer objects may be secure** through Domain Controller policy inheritance
- **Focus shifts to genuine risks** rather than configuration style preferences

**This means your environment is likely MORE secure than older tools indicated!**

> **📚 For Technical Details**: See the [References section](#references) for links to official Microsoft documentation explaining the November 2022 changes and modern Kerberos logic.

**Important Note**: User objects are not scanned because `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` is a computer-based setting only. User Kerberos encryption is controlled by:
- The computer they authenticate from
- Domain-level Group Policy settings
- Domain Controller configuration

### Skip GPO Checking

Skip Group Policy verification (faster execution):

```powershell
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -SkipGPOCheck
```

### GPO Analysis Only

Perform only Group Policy analysis without scanning objects:

```powershell
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -GPOCheckOnly
```

This mode provides comprehensive post-November 2022 environment security analysis based on GPO configuration quality.

### GPO Scope Selection

Check GPO settings at specific organizational levels:

```powershell
# Check only Domain Controllers OU
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -GPOScope DomainControllers

# Check only Domain level
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -GPOScope Domain

# Check both Domain and Domain Controllers OU (default)
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -GPOScope Both

# Check all OUs in the domain
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -GPOScope AllOUs

# Check a specific OU only
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -GPOScope "OU=IT,DC=contoso,DC=com"

# Check a specific OU with debug output
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -GPOScope "OU=Servers,OU=IT,DC=contoso,DC=com" -DebugMode
```

### Cross-Forest Scanning

Scan a different forest via forest trust relationships:

```powershell
# Scan a target forest using forest trust
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -TargetForest target.com

# Specify both target forest and domain controller
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -TargetForest target.com -Server dc01.target.com

# Debug cross-forest scanning
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -TargetForest target.com -DebugMode -ExportResults
```

### Server Connectivity

Connect to a specific domain controller:

```powershell
# Specify domain controller
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -Server dc01.contoso.com

# Combine with other parameters
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -Server dc01.contoso.com -DebugMode -ExportResults
```

When using `-ApplyFixes`, the script will:
- Prompt for each object that needs remediation
- Allow you to choose whether to fix each individual object
- Apply AES-only encryption settings (value 24 = 0x18)

When using `-ApplyFixes -Force`, the script will:
- **Automatically remediate all flagged objects** without individual prompts
- Display a **5-second countdown warning** before starting automatic remediation
- Allow cancellation during the countdown period (Ctrl+C)
- Apply AES-only encryption settings (value 24 = 0x18) to all objects
- Provide progress feedback during bulk remediation
- **Use with caution**: Intended for bulk operations and automated deployments

### Force Parameter Safety Features

The Force parameter includes several safety mechanisms:

1. **Parameter Validation**: Can only be used with `-ApplyFixes` parameter
2. **Countdown Warning**: 5-second delay with cancellation option before remediation begins
3. **Clear Messaging**: Distinguishes "Force mode" from "Interactive mode" in all output
4. **Progress Feedback**: Shows which objects are being remediated in real-time
5. **Same Remediation Logic**: Uses identical remediation code as interactive mode

**⚠️ Important**: Force mode is designed for scenarios where you've already verified the objects to be remediated and want to perform bulk operations without manual confirmation.

### Force Parameter Use Cases

**Ideal scenarios for `-Force` parameter:**

1. **Automated Deployments**: Script execution in automated deployment pipelines
2. **Bulk Remediation**: Large environments with many objects requiring remediation
3. **Scheduled Maintenance**: Unattended execution during maintenance windows
4. **Post-Audit Cleanup**: After manual review, bulk fix all identified issues
5. **Disaster Recovery**: Rapid restoration of security settings after incidents

**When NOT to use `-Force` parameter:**

1. **First-time execution**: Always run interactively first to understand impact
2. **Production discovery**: Initial audit of unknown environments
3. **Selective remediation**: When you want to fix only specific objects
4. **Learning/testing**: When exploring the tool's capabilities
5. **Uncertain environments**: When the impact of changes is unclear

When using `-ExportResults`, the script will:
- Create a timestamped CSV file with all audit results
- Save the file in the current directory with format: `RC4_Audit_Results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`
- Display the export path upon completion

When using `-SkipGPOCheck`, the script will:
- Skip the Group Policy verification phase
- Provide faster execution for object-only auditing
- Still perform comprehensive object scanning

When using `-GPOCheckOnly`, the script will:
- Perform only Group Policy analysis without scanning objects
- Provide detailed GPO configuration analysis and recommendations
- Deliver comprehensive post-November 2022 environment security assessment
- Categorize domains by security posture (EXCELLENT/MIXED/NEEDS IMPROVEMENT)
- Skip the potentially time-consuming object enumeration phase
- Exit after GPO analysis is complete with tailored next steps guidance
- Useful for policy validation and compliance checking

When using `-GPOScope`, you can specify:
- **Domain**: Check GPOs linked to the domain root (affects all objects)
- **DomainControllers**: Check GPOs linked to Domain Controllers OU (affects DCs only)
- **Both**: Check both domain root and Domain Controllers OU for comprehensive coverage (default)
- **AllOUs**: Check GPOs linked to all organizational units in the domain
- **OU=<DN>**: Check GPOs linked to a specific organizational unit only

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed troubleshooting output for GPO detection:

```powershell
# Enable debug output
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -DebugMode

# Combine with other parameters
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -DebugMode -GPOScope DomainControllers -ExportResults
```

When using `-TargetForest`, you can:
- Scan a different forest when your user account is in a different forest
- Leverage existing forest trust relationships for cross-forest auditing
- Combine with `-Server` to target specific domain controllers in the target forest
- Audit multiple forests from a central management forest

When using `-Server`, you can:
- Connect to a specific domain controller when having connectivity issues
- Target testing against particular DCs
- Work around network or authentication issues

When using `-DebugMode`, the script will:
- Show detailed GPO processing steps
- Display GPO link detection progress with multiple detection methods
- Report encryption setting analysis details with decoded values
- Help troubleshoot GPO detection issues with comprehensive logging
- Show detailed trust information during scanning (name, type, direction, encryption status)
- Display secure object findings during scanning for comprehensive visibility

## Enhanced GPO Analysis & Assessment Logic

### Intelligent GPO Recognition (NEW in v6.0)

The script now includes advanced pattern recognition to intelligently assess GPOs based on their names and content:

#### Smart Pattern Detection
- **Kerberos Name Patterns**: Recognizes GPO names containing keywords like "kerberos", "encrypt", "aes", "rc4", "cipher"
- **Content Analysis**: Analyzes GPO content for encryption-related settings and keywords
- **Context-Aware Assessment**: Provides different evaluation logic based on GPO purpose and configuration hints

#### Three-Tier Assessment Categories

**1. OPTIMAL (Green)**
- GPO verified working through computer object analysis
- Computers show proper AES encryption values applied
- GPO XML parsing may fail, but verification confirms effectiveness

**2. LIKELY SECURE (Yellow)**
- GPO name/content suggests Kerberos encryption configuration
- GPO appears properly configured but no computers show applied settings yet
- Common scenario: Newly created/linked GPO or computers haven't refreshed policy
- **Recommendation**: Run `gpupdate /force` on test computers and re-scan

**3. CONFIGURATION UNCLEAR (Yellow)**
- GPO appears to be Kerberos-related but settings cannot be parsed or verified
- **Recommendation**: Manual verification in GPMC required

**4. NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (Red)**
- Clear configuration issues requiring immediate attention
- Traditional assessment for GPOs that clearly need fixes

#### Enhanced Messaging Examples

**For Kerberos-Related GPOs (e.g., "KerberosEncTypes"):**
```
> ASSESSMENT: LIKELY SECURE (GPO appears configured for AES)
  > GPO name suggests Kerberos encryption: 'KerberosEncTypes'
  > GPO contains encryption-related settings
  > No computers found with applied settings yet
  > RECOMMENDATION: Run 'gpupdate /force' on a few computers and re-scan
  > Note: New/recently modified GPOs may take time to apply
```

**For Non-Kerberos GPOs with Issues:**
```
> ASSESSMENT: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
  > AES128 not enabled
  > AES256 not enabled
  > RC4 not disabled (SECURITY RISK)
  > RECOMMENDATION: Configure 'Network security: Configure encryption types
    allowed for Kerberos' = AES128_HMAC_SHA1, AES256_HMAC_SHA1
```

### Benefits of Enhanced Assessment

✅ **Eliminates Confusing False Negatives**: No more "NEEDS IMPROVEMENT" messages for properly configured GPOs  
✅ **Provides Context-Specific Guidance**: Different recommendations based on GPO type and status  
✅ **Handles GPO Refresh Timing**: Recognizes newly applied GPOs that need time to propagate  
✅ **Improves Accuracy**: Combines name analysis, content detection, and computer verification  
✅ **Reduces Administrative Confusion**: Clear, actionable assessments instead of contradictory messages

## Enhanced GPO-Only Mode Analysis

### Post-November 2022 Environment Security Assessment

The GPO-only mode (`-GPOCheckOnly`) now provides comprehensive security analysis based on your forest's GPO configuration quality. This analysis helps you understand your environment's readiness for post-November 2022 Kerberos security benefits.

#### Environment Security Status Categories

**🟢 EXCELLENT Security Status**
- All domains have optimal or secure GPO configuration
- Trust objects will default to AES when encryption types undefined
- Computer objects inherit secure DC policies from proper GPO configuration
- Object scanning would likely show minimal issues due to proper GPO foundation

**🟡 MIXED Security Status**
- Some domains have secure configuration, others need improvement
- Partial security benefits available across the forest
- Object scanning recommended to identify specific risks in problematic domains
- Consider standardizing GPO configuration across all domains

**🔴 NEEDS IMPROVEMENT Security Status**
- No domains have adequate GPO configuration
- Environment vulnerable to RC4 fallback scenarios
- Trust objects may fall back to RC4 in some scenarios
- Computer objects likely lack proper AES enforcement
- Immediate GPO remediation recommended before object-level fixes

#### Domain Configuration Categories

The script categorizes each domain based on GPO quality:

- **Optimal GPO**: AES-only configuration (RC4 and DES disabled) - Best security posture
- **Secure GPO**: AES enabled with legacy protocols (mixed mode) - Good security with compatibility
- **Suboptimal GPO**: Weak configuration or improper settings - Needs improvement
- **No GPO**: No Kerberos encryption policy found - Requires immediate attention

#### Sample GPO-Only Analysis Output

```powershell
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -GPOCheckOnly
```

**Sample Output for EXCELLENT Environment:**
```
>> POST-NOVEMBER 2022 ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS
>> Forest: contoso.com
>> Total domains analyzed: 3

> ENVIRONMENT SECURITY STATUS: EXCELLENT

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| All domains have secure or optimal GPO configuration!                       |
| Post-November 2022 Analysis: Environment supports secure defaults           |
| • Trust objects: Will default to AES when encryption types undefined       |
| • Computer objects: Will inherit secure DC policies from proper GPO config |
| • Object scanning would likely show minimal issues due to proper foundation |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

>> SECURE ENVIRONMENT BREAKDOWN:
  ✅ Domains with OPTIMAL settings: 2
     • contoso.com
     • child.contoso.com
  ✅ Domains with SECURE settings: 1
     • partner.contoso.com

>> NEXT STEPS:
  1. Run full object scan to verify: .\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1
  2. Focus on trust objects (GPO doesn't apply to trusts)
  3. Monitor authentication logs for any remaining RC4 usage
```

#### Benefits of GPO-Only Mode Analysis

1. **Quick Assessment**: Rapidly evaluate environment security without time-consuming object enumeration
2. **Actionable Insights**: Provides specific next steps based on your configuration quality
3. **Post-November 2022 Context**: Leverages modern Microsoft guidance for accurate risk assessment
4. **Forest-Wide View**: Comprehensive analysis across all domains in the forest
5. **Compliance Ready**: Helps demonstrate security posture for audit and compliance purposes

## Enhanced Trust Analysis

### Detailed Trust Information
The script now provides comprehensive trust analysis including:
- **Trust Types**: TreeRoot, ParentChild, External, Forest, Shortcut, Unknown
- **Trust Directions**: Inbound, Outbound, Bidirectional  
- **Trust Status**: Shows which trusts have weak vs secure encryption
- **Trust Breakdown**: Categorized summary of trust types found

### Trust Type Explanations
- **TreeRoot**: Root domain of forest tree (automatically created)
- **ParentChild**: Child domain to parent domain (automatically created)
- **External**: Trust to external domain/forest (manually configured)
- **Forest**: Forest-level trust relationship (enterprise trust)
- **Shortcut**: Shortcut trust for optimization (performance enhancement)
- **Unknown**: Unrecognized trust type (requires investigation)

### Why You Might See More Trusts Than Expected
The script discovers all trust objects in Active Directory, including:
- **System-created trusts**: Automatic forest structure trusts
- **Implicit trusts**: Not always visible in GUI management tools
- **Historical trusts**: Previously configured relationships
- **Kerberos realm trusts**: For mixed authentication environments

## Secure Objects Reporting

### Comprehensive Security Overview
The script now tracks and reports on objects that already have secure encryption settings:

#### Secure Objects Summary
- **Total secure objects count**: Complete inventory of properly configured objects
- **Breakdown by type**: Separate counts for computers vs trusts
- **Encryption type analysis**: Shows what specific AES configurations are in use

#### Smart Display Logic
- **Detailed view (≤50 objects)**: Full table with all secure objects
- **Summary view (>50 objects)**: Domain-grouped summary to prevent output overflow
- **Debug visibility**: Enhanced debug output shows secure objects during scanning

#### Benefits of Secure Objects Tracking
- **Progress monitoring**: Track remediation progress over time
- **Compliance verification**: Validate that security improvements are effective
- **Complete picture**: See both problems AND successes in your environment
- **Audit evidence**: Document current secure configuration status

## Critical Security Information: Trust Objects and GPO Limitations

### ⚠️ Why GPO Doesn't Fix Trust Objects

**IMPORTANT**: The Group Policy "Network security: Configure encryption types allowed for Kerberos" **DOES NOT** apply to trust objects. However, **post-November 2022**, trust objects with undefined encryption types now **default to AES** (secure by default).

> **📖 Official Microsoft Guidance**: [Trust objects no longer require manual AES configuration after November 2022 updates](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/coreinfrastructureandsecurityblog/decrypting-the-selection-of-supported-kerberos-encryption-types/1628797) - See the update note in Microsoft's official documentation.

#### What GPO Controls
- ✅ **Domain Controllers** (computer accounts)
- ✅ **Member computers and servers**
- ✅ **What encryption types DCs accept/request**

#### What GPO Does NOT Control  
- ❌ **Trust objects** (forest/domain trusts)
- ❌ **Trust encryption type offerings**
- ❌ **Inter-domain authentication preferences**

### 🔧 Trust Object Remediation Requirements

Trust objects store their own `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` attribute and require explicit modification:

#### Manual Remediation Methods

**Option 1: Use This Script (Recommended)**
```powershell
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -ApplyFixes
```
The script automatically uses the ksetup command following Microsoft's official Method 3 for AES-only trust configuration.

**Option 2: Active Directory Domains and Trusts Console (GUI)**
1. Open **Active Directory Domains and Trusts**
2. Right-click on your domain → **Properties**
3. Go to the **Trusts** tab
4. Select the trust relationship → **Properties**
5. Check the box: **"The other domain supports Kerberos AES Encryption"**
6. Click **OK** to apply the setting

This GUI option is equivalent to Method 3 from Microsoft's official documentation and sets AES-only encryption.

**Option 3: Manual ksetup Command (Advanced)**

⚠️ **CRITICAL: ksetup Domain Context Requirements**

The ksetup command has a strict requirement: **You can ONLY configure encryption types for the OTHER domain in the trust relationship.** Running ksetup from the wrong domain controller will result in error `0xc0000034`.

**Examples of Correct Usage:**
```powershell
# Scenario 1: From child.contoso.com DC, configure parent domain trust
ksetup /setenctypeattr contoso.com AES128-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96 AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96

# Scenario 2: From contoso.com DC, configure child domain trust  
ksetup /setenctypeattr child.contoso.com AES128-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96 AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96

# Verify the setting
ksetup /getenctypeattr <trustdomain>
```

**Trust Direction Guidelines:**
- **Outbound Trust**: Run ksetup from the target domain's DC to configure your domain
- **Inbound Trust**: Run ksetup from your domain's DC to configure the target domain  
- **Bidirectional Trust**: Must run ksetup from BOTH domain controllers

**Common Error 0xc0000034:**
This error occurs when you try to configure a domain from the wrong context. The solution is to run the ksetup command from the OTHER domain's domain controller.

**Alternative**: Use the GUI method (Active Directory Domains and Trusts) which handles the domain context automatically and is often more reliable for complex trust scenarios.

**Reference**: [Microsoft Official Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/unsupported-etype-error-accessing-trusted-domain#method-3-configure-the-trust-to-support-aes128-and-aes-256-encryption-instead-of-rc4-encryption)

#### Verification Commands
```powershell
# Verify trust settings after modification
Get-ADObject -Filter 'ObjectClass -eq "trustedDomain"' -Properties msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes | 
    Select Name, msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes

# Monitor Kerberos authentication events for trusts
# Check Event IDs 4768/4769 in Security log for AES usage confirmation
```

### 💡 Complete Security Strategy

For comprehensive RC4 elimination, you need **both**:

1. **GPO Deployment**
   - Controls what DCs and computers accept/request
   - Applies to computer accounts automatically
   - Configured via Group Policy Management

2. **Trust Object Remediation**  
   - Controls what trust objects offer during inter-domain authentication
   - Requires manual attribute modification
   - Not affected by GPO settings

**Without updating trust objects, RC4 can still appear in inter-domain authentication even with optimal GPO settings!**

### 🚨 Common Misconception

Many administrators assume that applying the Kerberos encryption GPO will fix all RC4 issues. This is **incorrect** for trust objects. The script specifically identifies and helps remediate trust objects separately from computer objects.

### 📊 Trust Object Impact

Trust objects affect:
- **Forest-to-forest authentication**
- **Domain-to-domain authentication within forest**
- **Cross-domain resource access**
- **Distributed application authentication**

Leaving trust objects with RC4 creates security gaps that GPO cannot address.

## Understanding msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes

### Computer-Based Setting Only

The `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` attribute is a **computer-based setting only** and does not apply to user objects. This is a common misconception in Kerberos security auditing.

**CRITICAL NOTE**: Trust objects are a special case - they DO use `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` but are NOT controlled by computer GPO policies. See the "Trust Objects and GPO Limitations" section above for details.

#### Why Users Are Not Scanned
- **User Kerberos encryption** is determined by the computer they authenticate from, not by a user attribute
- **Domain policy** controls user authentication encryption types through GPO settings
- **Domain Controllers** enforce encryption requirements based on computer and domain settings

- **Setting user attributes** for encryption types has no effect on Kerberos authentication

#### How User Kerberos Encryption Works
1. **Computer-Side Control**: The computer account's `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` determines what encryption types the computer supports
2. **Domain Policy**: GPO settings like "Network security: Configure encryption types allowed for Kerberos" control domain-wide encryption requirements
3. **DC Configuration**: Domain Controllers enforce these policies during authentication

4. **Result**: User Kerberos tickets use encryption types based on computer capabilities and domain policy, not user attributes

#### What This Tool Audits
- ✅ **Computer Objects**: Have `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` attribute that controls their Kerberos encryption capabilities
- ✅ **Domain Trusts**: Have encryption type settings that affect cross-domain authentication (require manual remediation - see Trust Objects section)
- ✅ **Domain Controllers**: Special computer objects that need secure encryption for all authentication

- ❌ **User Objects**: Do not have relevant encryption type attributes (not scanned by this tool)

### Practical Implications
- **User Security**: Controlled by ensuring all computers have strong encryption settings
- **Domain Security**: Managed through Group Policy that applies to computer objects
- **Audit Focus**: Concentrate on computer objects and domain trust relationships
- **Remediation**: Fix computer encryption settings via GPO; fix trust objects manually (see Trust Objects section)

## Parameter Sets

The script uses **PowerShell parameter sets** to prevent contradictory parameter combinations and provide clear usage patterns:

### Force Parameter Requirements

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The `-Force` parameter can **only** be used with `-ApplyFixes`. This logical restriction is enforced by PowerShell parameter sets:

- ✅ **Valid**: `.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -ApplyFixes -Force` (Automatic remediation)
- ❌ **Invalid**: `.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -Force` (Force without remediation)
- ❌ **Invalid**: `.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -GPOCheckOnly -Force` (Force with analysis-only mode)

The Force parameter is designed for **bulk remediation scenarios** where you want to automatically fix all detected issues without manual confirmation prompts.

### Available Parameter Sets

| Parameter Set | Required Parameters | Compatible Parameters | Purpose |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------|
| **Standard** | *(none)* | `-ApplyFixes`, `-Force`, `-ExportResults`, `-GPOScope`, `-DebugMode`, `-Server`, `-TargetForest` | Normal operation with optional GPO analysis |

| **GPOOnly** | `-GPOCheckOnly` | `-ExportResults`, `-GPOScope`, `-DebugMode`, `-Server`, `-TargetForest` | GPO analysis only without object scanning |
| **Help** | `-Help` | `-ExportResults`, `-DebugMode`, `-Server`, `-TargetForest` | Display detailed help information |
| **QuickHelp** | `-QuickHelp` | `-ExportResults`, `-DebugMode`, `-Server`, `-TargetForest` | Display quick reference guide |

### Parameter Set Benefits

1. **Automatic Validation**: PowerShell prevents contradictory combinations automatically
2. **Clear Error Messages**: Built-in "Parameter set cannot be resolved" errors when invalid combinations are used
3. **IntelliSense Support**: Better tab completion and parameter suggestions in PowerShell ISE/VS Code
4. **Self-Documenting**: Parameter relationships are explicit and enforceable
5. **Maintainable**: No complex manual validation logic required

### Prevented Parameter Combinations

The parameter sets automatically prevent these contradictory combinations:

- ❌ **`-SkipGPOCheck -GPOCheckOnly`** → Mutually exclusive (cannot skip and check GPOs simultaneously)
- ❌ **`-SkipGPOCheck -GPOScope`** → GPO scope is irrelevant when skipping GPO checks  
- ❌ **`-GPOCheckOnly -ApplyFixes`** → Cannot modify objects in GPO-only analysis mode

### Parameter Set Examples

- `-GPOCheckOnly -ApplyFixes` ❌ GPO-only mode cannot modify objects
- `-Force` (without `-ApplyFixes`) ❌ Force requires remediation mode
- `-GPOCheckOnly -Force` ❌ Analysis-only mode doesn't need Force

## GPOScope Parameter Options

The `-GPOScope` parameter supports the following values with **intelligent tab completion** for common options:

- **Domain**: Check GPO links at domain root level only
- **DomainControllers**: Check GPO links at Domain Controllers OU only  
- **Both**: Check both domain root and Domain Controllers OU (default)
- **AllOUs**: Check all organizational units in the domain
- **OU=<Distinguished Name>**: Check a specific OU path only

### Enhanced Usability Features

- **Tab Completion**: Press `Tab` after `-GPOScope ` to cycle through common values (Domain, DomainControllers, Both, AllOUs)
- **Custom OU Support**: Still accepts any valid OU distinguished name for specific targeting
- **IntelliSense**: PowerShell ISE and VS Code provide automatic suggestions

### GPOScope Examples

```powershell
# Check only Domain Controllers OU for GPO links
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -GPOScope DomainControllers

# Check all OUs in the domain for GPO links
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -GPOScope AllOUs

# Check a specific OU for GPO links
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -GPOScope "OU=IT,DC=contoso,DC=com"

# Check specific nested OU with debug output
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -GPOScope "OU=Servers,OU=IT,DC=contoso,DC=com" -DebugMode
```

### GPOScope Validation

The script validates the specified OU exists before proceeding. If an invalid OU path is provided, it will fall back to the default "Both" behavior and display an error message.

## Understanding the Output

The script displays encryption types for each flagged computer object:
- **Not Set (RC4 fallback)**: No encryption types specified, defaults to RC4
- **AES128-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96**: Strong AES 128-bit encryption
- **AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96**: Strong AES 256-bit encryption

### Encryption Type Values

The `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` attribute uses bitwise flags:
- `0x1` - DES-CBC-CRC (deprecated)
- `0x2` - DES-CBC-MD5 (deprecated)
- `0x4` - RC4-HMAC (weak)
- `0x8` - AES128-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96 (recommended)
- `0x10` - AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96 (recommended)
- `0x20` - Future use

Recommended setting: `24` (0x18) = AES128 + AES256

## Cross-Forest Trust Requirements

When using `-TargetForest` to scan a different forest, ensure the following requirements are met:

### Forest Trust Configuration
- **Forest Trust Relationship**: A two-way forest trust must exist between your current forest and the target forest
- **Trust Direction**: The trust must allow authentication from your forest to the target forest
- **Trust Authentication**: The forest trust should be configured for both authentication and authorization

### Account Permissions
- **Cross-Forest Permissions**: Your user account must have appropriate permissions in the target forest
- **Delegation Rights**: Consider using account delegation or service accounts with cross-forest permissions
- **Domain Admin/Enterprise Admin**: Required permissions in the target forest for full auditing capabilities

### Network Connectivity
- **DNS Resolution**: Ensure DNS can resolve domain controllers in the target forest
- **Firewall Rules**: Required ports (135, 389, 636, 445, 49152-65535) must be open between forests
- **Domain Controller Discovery**: The script will attempt to auto-discover DCs in the target forest

### Troubleshooting Cross-Forest Issues
If you encounter authentication or connectivity issues:

```powershell
# Test basic forest trust connectivity
nltest /trusted_domains

# Test authentication to target forest
runas /netonly /user:TARGETFOREST\username powershell

# Verify trust relationship status
netdom trust SOURCEFOREST /domain:TARGETFOREST /verify

# Use specific domain controller if auto-discovery fails
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -TargetForest target.com -Server dc01.target.com
```

## Windows Server 2025 Compatibility

**Critical Update**: Windows Server 2025 introduces significant changes to Kerberos encryption handling:
- Windows Server 2025 domain controllers **disable RC4 fallback by default**
- Objects with undefined `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` will **fail authentication**
- This affects objects that previously relied on automatic RC4 fallback

### RC4 Fallback Mechanism Disabled
- **Immediate Action Required**: Audit all objects before upgrading to Server 2025
- **Test Environment**: Validate encryption settings in non-production first
- **Production Planning**: Set explicit AES encryption for all objects

### Identifying At-Risk Objects
This script specifically identifies objects showing **"Not Set (RC4 fallback)"** which will be affected by Server 2025 changes. These objects require immediate attention to prevent authentication failures.

## Group Policy Configuration

You can also configure encryption types through Group Policy instead of manually setting the `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` attribute:

### Automatic GPO Verification
The script automatically checks for existing Kerberos encryption Group Policy settings and reports:
- ✅ **Compliant GPOs**: Policies with recommended AES-only settings
- ⚠️ **Non-optimal GPOs**: Policies that may still allow weak encryption
- ❌ **Missing GPOs**: Domains without Kerberos encryption policies
- 🔗 **Detailed Linking Status**: Shows all OUs where GPOs are applied with link order and enforcement status
- 📈 **Coverage Analysis**: Summarizes the scope of GPO application across the domain
- 📊 **Application Status**: Shows which objects already have GPO-applied settings vs manual/unset

### GPO Linking Strategy

**Critical Decision Point**: Where to apply the Kerberos encryption policy:

#### Option 1: Domain Level (Recommended for Most Organizations)
- **Target**: Domain root
- **Scope**: All users and computers in the domain
- **Use Case**: Organization-wide security policy
- **Pros**: Comprehensive coverage, consistent policy
- **Cons**: May affect legacy applications

#### Option 2: Domain Controllers OU Only
- **Target**: Domain Controllers OU
- **Scope**: Domain Controllers only
- **Use Case**: DC-specific hardening while maintaining compatibility
- **Pros**: Secures critical infrastructure, minimal application impact
- **Cons**: Client computers still vulnerable to RC4

#### Option 3: Both Levels (Maximum Security)
- **Target**: Domain root + Domain Controllers OU
- **Scope**: Different policies for DCs vs other objects
- **Use Case**: Graduated security approach
- **Pros**: Flexible, allows different settings per object type
- **Cons**: More complex to manage

#### GPO Application Status Analysis

The script provides detailed categorization of encryption settings for computer objects:

- **GPO Applied (AES-only)**: Computer objects with `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes = 24` (AES128+AES256)
- **Manual Settings (custom)**: Computer objects with non-standard encryption values (not 24) 
- **Not Set (RC4 fallback)**: Computer objects without `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` attribute

This analysis helps you understand:
- How effectively your GPO policies are being applied to computer objects
- Which computer objects have been manually configured with custom encryption settings
- Which computer objects are at risk due to undefined encryption types

**Note**: User objects are not included in this analysis as they don't use the `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` attribute.

### Understanding GPO Link Details

When checking GPO settings with `-GPOScope Both`, the script provides detailed information about where Kerberos encryption GPOs are linked:
- **✅ OU Name [Order: X]**: GPO is enabled and linked to this OU
- **❌ OU Name [Order: X]**: GPO is linked but disabled
- **(Enforced)**: GPO link is enforced (cannot be blocked by child containers)

#### Link Status Indicators
- **Complete**: Linked to both Domain and Domain Controllers OU
- **Domain-wide**: Linked to Domain root (affects all objects)  
- **Domain Controllers**: Linked only to DC OU
- **Specific OUs**: Linked to selected organizational units only

#### Coverage Analysis
- **Lower numbers = Higher priority** (Order 1 processes before Order 2)
- **Conflicts resolved by precedence** (last applied wins)
- **Enforced links override** child container settings

#### Link Order Significance
1. **Phase 1**: Apply to Domain Controllers OU first (minimize risk)
2. **Phase 2**: Test with pilot groups using domain-level GPO
3. **Phase 3**: Roll out domain-level GPO organization-wide
4. **Phase 4**: Optionally maintain separate DC-specific settings

### Policy Location
**Path**: `Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options`

**Policy**: `Network security: Configure encryption types allowed for Kerberos`

**Recommended Settings**:
- ✅ **AES128_HMAC_SHA1**
- ✅ **AES256_HMAC_SHA1** 
- ❌ **DES_CBC_CRC** (uncheck - deprecated)
- ❌ **DES_CBC_MD5** (uncheck - deprecated)
- ❌ **RC4_HMAC_MD5** (uncheck - weak)

### User Configuration
**Note**: The same policy also exists under User Configuration, but Computer Configuration takes precedence for computer accounts.

### GPO Application Timeline

**CRITICAL**: Understanding when GPO settings take effect is essential for planning:

#### For Computer Accounts
- **GPO Application**: Next computer startup or `gpupdate /force`
- **Kerberos Ticket Refresh**: New tickets issued use new encryption settings immediately after GPO application
- **Active Tickets**: Existing tickets continue with old encryption until they expire (typically 10 hours)
- **Full Effect**: Complete transition occurs after ticket expiration + GPO refresh

#### For User Accounts  
- **GPO Application**: Next user logon or `gpupdate /force`
- **Kerberos Ticket Refresh**: New tickets issued use new encryption settings immediately after GPO application
- **Active Tickets**: Existing tickets continue with old encryption until they expire (typically 10 hours)
- **Full Effect**: Complete transition occurs after ticket expiration + GPO refresh

#### Timeline Summary
1. **Immediate (0-15 minutes)**: GPO refresh on clients
2. **Short-term (15 minutes - 10 hours)**: Mixed encryption environment (new tickets AES, old tickets may still be RC4)
3. **Complete (10+ hours)**: All tickets using new encryption settings

#### Monitoring GPO Application
Use these commands to verify GPO application:
```cmd
# Check GPO application status
gpresult /h gpresult.html

# Force GPO refresh
gpupdate /force

# Check current Kerberos tickets after GPO refresh
klist
```

**Note**: This GPO setting affects the same underlying `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` attribute that this script audits. Applying the recommended GPO settings will resolve the issues identified by this audit tool.

### GPO vs Direct Attribute Setting

| Method | Scope | Management | Recommendation |
|--------|-------|------------|----------------|
| **GPO** | Organization-wide, inherited | Centralized, version controlled | ✅ **Preferred for production** |
| **Direct Attribute** | Per-object, explicit | Manual, script-based | ⚠️ **Use for exceptions only** |

**Best Practice**: Use GPO for organization-wide policy, use direct attribute setting only for specific exceptions or emergency remediation.

### GPO Deployment Strategy
1. **Test first**: Deploy to a test OU before production
2. **Staged rollout**: Apply to different OUs in phases
3. **Monitor**: Check for authentication issues after deployment
4. **Verify**: Run this audit script after GPO application to confirm remediation

## Manual Monitoring with klist

After implementing RC4 remediation, you can manually monitor Kerberos tickets to verify that weak encryption ciphers are no longer being used. Use the `klist` command to inspect current Kerberos tickets:

### Check Current Tickets
```cmd
klist
```

### Detailed Ticket Information
```cmd
klist -li 0x3e7 tickets
```

### Look for Encryption Types
Pay attention to the **Encryption Type** field in the output:
- **RC4-HMAC (0x17)** - Weak encryption (should be eliminated)
- **AES128-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96 (0x11)** - Strong encryption ✅
- **AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96 (0x12)** - Strong encryption ✅

### Example Output After Remediation
```
Current LogonId is 0:0x3e7

Cached Tickets: (2)

#0>	Client: user@CONTOSO.COM
	Server: krbtgt/CONTOSO.COM@CONTOSO.COM
	KerbTicket Encryption Type: AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
	Ticket Flags 0x40e10000 -> forwardable renewable initial pre_authent name_canonicalize
	Start Time: 10/28/2025 10:00:00 (local)
	End Time:   10/28/2025 20:00:00 (local)
	Renew Time: 11/4/2025 10:00:00 (local)
	Session Key Type: AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
```

If you still see RC4-HMAC encryption types after remediation, it indicates that some objects may still need to be addressed.

## Impact on NTLM Authentication

**Important**: The RC4 encryption settings configured by this tool **only affect Kerberos authentication**, not NTLM authentication. Here's what you need to know:

### NTLM vs Kerberos
- **Kerberos**: Uses the `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` attribute that this tool audits and remediates
- **NTLM**: Uses password hashes stored separately and is not affected by these encryption type settings

### NTLM Security Considerations
- NTLM authentication will continue to work normally after RC4 remediation
- NTLM inherently uses weaker security than Kerberos with AES
- Consider implementing NTLM restrictions through Group Policy for enhanced security:
  - `Network Security: Restrict NTLM: NTLM authentication in this domain`
  - `Network Security: Restrict NTLM: Incoming NTLM traffic`
  - `Network Security: Restrict NTLM: Outgoing NTLM traffic to remote servers`

### Recommended Security Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Implement RC4 remediation for Kerberos (this tool)
2. **Phase 2**: Gradually restrict NTLM usage through Group Policy
3. **Phase 3**: Monitor authentication logs to ensure compatibility
4. **Phase 4**: Consider disabling NTLM entirely in highly secure environments

## Exporting Results

### Automatic Export with Switch
Use the `-ExportResults` parameter to automatically export results:

```powershell
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -ExportResults
```

This creates a timestamped CSV file: `RC4_Audit_Results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`

### Manual Export (Legacy)
Alternatively, uncomment the last line in the script for manual export:

```powershell
$results | Export-Csv ".\RC4_Audit_Results.csv" -NoTypeInformation -Encoding UTF8
```

### CSV File Contents
The exported CSV includes:
- **Domain**: Domain name where the object is located
- **ObjectType**: Computer or Trust (User objects are not scanned)
- **Name**: Object name (SamAccountName or Trust name)
- **DN**: Distinguished Name of the object
- **EncTypes**: Current encryption types in human-readable format

## Security Considerations

- **Test first**: Run in audit mode before applying fixes
- **Backup**: Ensure you have AD backups before making changes
- **Compatibility**: Verify that all applications support AES encryption
- **Staged rollout**: Consider fixing objects in phases rather than all at once
- **Monitor authentication**: Use `klist` to verify that RC4 tickets are no longer issued
- **NTLM limitation**: Remember that this tool only addresses Kerberos encryption; NTLM authentication is not affected
- **Event monitoring**: Monitor Windows Security logs (Event IDs 4768, 4769) for authentication issues after remediation
- **Legacy applications**: Some older applications may require additional configuration to work with AES-only settings

## Troubleshooting

### Administrator Privileges Required
The script will automatically check for Administrator privileges and exit with an error if not running as Administrator:

```
❌ ERROR: This script must be run as Administrator!
Required privileges:
- Domain Administrator (for scanning and fixing users/computers)
- Enterprise Administrator (for fixing domain trusts)

Please restart PowerShell as Administrator and try again.
```

**Solution**: Right-click on PowerShell and select "Run as Administrator"

### Permission Issues
Ensure you're running as a user with appropriate AD permissions:
- Domain Admin for scanning and fixing users/computers
- Enterprise Admin for fixing domain trusts

### Module Not Found
Install the Active Directory PowerShell module:
```powershell
# On Windows Server
Add-WindowsFeature RSAT-AD-PowerShell

# On Windows 10/11
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name "Rsat.ActiveDirectory.DS-LDS.Tools"
```

## Troubleshooting & Debugging

### Enable Debug Output
Use the `-DebugMode` parameter to see detailed processing information:
```powershell
.\RC4_AD_SCAN.ps1 -DebugMode
```

Debug output includes:
- **GPO Processing**: Shows GPO discovery, XML parsing, and application logic
- **Trust Analysis**: Displays trust object discovery, type detection, and direction analysis
- **Secure Objects Tracking**: Shows objects being added to secure collection
- **Object Processing**: Details attribute reading and classification logic
- **Cross-Forest Operations**: Forest connection details and domain discovery

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Cannot find forest" error
**Solution**: Ensure you have appropriate permissions and network connectivity to the target forest

**Issue**: GPO links not detected
**Solution**: Verify Group Policy Management Tools are installed and you have read permissions on GPOs

**Issue**: Access denied on cross-forest operations
**Solution**: Ensure trust relationships are established and you have cross-forest permissions

**Issue**: Trust objects not found
**Solution**: Trusts are stored in CN=System container - ensure you have read permissions

### PowerShell Requirements
- **PowerShell Version**: 5.1 or later
- **Modules Required**: ActiveDirectory (automatically imported)
- **Optional Modules**: GroupPolicy (for GPO checking)
- **Permissions**: Domain Admin or equivalent for full functionality

### Windows Server 2025 Considerations
- RC4 fallback is disabled by default
- Objects with "Not Set" encryption will fail authentication
- Test thoroughly in lab environment before production deployment
- Consider gradual rollout with proper monitoring
